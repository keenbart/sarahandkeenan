                Seven years together is about enough time to generate four million photos.
                We've narrowed it to just a few that depict special moments we've shared.
                A long distance relationship is a perfect excuse to travel together, though,
                at first, it was only brief sightings in these cities.
                Now, we've finally migrated to Chicago, where you'll join us in the fall.
