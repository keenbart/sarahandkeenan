                Seven years together is about enough time to generate four million photos.
                We've narrowed it to just a few that depict special moments we've shared.
                A long distance relationship is a perfect excuse to travel together, though,
                at first, it was only brief sightings in these cities.
                Now, we've finally migrated to Chicago, where we hope you'll join us in the fall.

                        We met at the University of Rochester our freshman year of college.
                        We would have been a classic freshman-floor couple, except that we didn't
                        actually start dating until Sarah had already decided to transfer
                        to Washington University in St. Louis. So began four years of long distance...

                        Sarah visited Keenan in Rochester for our first New Year's together
                        and we spent it with Keenan's family and friends. It was a chance for
                        Keenan's friends (who had been trying forever to get us to start dating) to
                        see their persistence pay off. We love living in Chicago, but Rochester is
                        still a second home.

                        Keenan visited Sarah in St. Louis many times over their first year of dating long distance.
                        We learned that over a three-day visit, the first day was always
                        slightly awkward, and the third day was always slightly sad,
                        but the second day was perfect.

                        and Keenan met some of Sarah’s family and friends living in France.
                        We then visited Sarah’s Matron of Honor in Spain: without her guidance in Catalonia,
                        we probably would have been left muttering to people in Franglais, slowly maneuvering the city.

                        in India for the semester, and we were finally able to reunite and unwind on a
                        visit to the Chicago Botanic Garden...after months of
                        mismatched time zones and falling asleep on Skype.

                        of Sarah’s favorite lodgings in India: Spars Lodge in Shimla. Sarah introduced Keenan to the
                        Mehra family in Delhi, and Keenan earned the approval of Sarah's homestay mother, Mrs. Malik.

                        friends in DC. We fit in as many board game nights as we possibly could, and pretended
                        to be tourists to take in all the sights, like at the Cherry Blossom Festival in this photo.

                        friends who shared Sarah’s tendency towards over-sharing and Keenan’s love of music and board games.
                        We also managed to fit in a trip to one of our now-favorite places in Chicago, the Empty Bottle,
                        and stopped by the photobooth in the bar to take this pic.

                        travelled to Denver, Colorado and picked up Nova. She was smaller than we
                        expected and loved long car rides—which was lucky given the 3-day/40-hour
                        road trip from Colorado through Nevada to Chicago. There was a brief period of the puppy
                        blues as we also had to balance moving to a new city and Sarah restarting school,
                        but it was more than worth it, and we can't imagine life without Nova.

                        to officially ask. Keenan took Sarah on a walk to Promontory Point in Chicago,
                        and got down on one knee. Keenan was fumbling around in his pockets trying to find the
                        ring and Sarah was just about to tell him that it was okay and that we could try again
                        later...Keenan then quickly turned to Nova and asked her "Where did I put it?" Nova ran
                        over to the base of a tree nearby, picked up a ring box and brought it back to Keenan,
                        then sat and stared up at them expectantly. Little did Sarah know, Keenan and Nova
                        had been working together to prepare for this moment all summer while Sarah was away in India.
