                We'll provide transportation from downtown to the Chicago Botanic Garden
                and back on October 6. Shuttles will leave at 3:30pm from the Talbott hotel
                at 20 East Delaware Place, Chicago. The shuttle will return to the Talbott at
                the end of the night. It will depart from the gardens at 9:45pm for those
                who have to leave early, and again at 11pm when the reception ends.
                If you plan to use the shuttle, please include that information in your RSVP
                so we can get a sense of how many people we need to accomodate.

                    We've reserved blocks of rooms in two hotels in the
                    Gold Coast area of Chicago for our guests. The Ambassador
                    is on a quiet street just a few blocks north of Michigan Avenue
                    and a few blocks west of Lake Michigan. The Talbott is steps away
                    from restaurants and shops, a few blocks west of Michigan Avenue.
                    These hotels are holding a limited number of rooms at our rates until September 5th,
                    so please make your reservations as soon as possible.

                        Because October 5-7, 2018 is Chicago Marathon Weekend,
                        hotels are in demand and the rates are higher than usual.
                        In addition to the rooms we have blocked for the wedding,
                        the Chicago Marathon website has a
                        <!-- <a class="styled-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.chicagomarathon.com/participant-information/hotels-travel-parking#hotels">list of hotels offering special rates for the weekend.</a> -->
                        <a class="styled-link" href="https://registration.experientevent.com/ShowBCM181/Flow/ATTGROUP#/registrant//RoomSearch/" target="_blank">list of hotels offering special rates for the weekend</a>.
                        If you want to look into any of these hotels,
                        we suggest you look at hotels on the Near North Side—north of Grand Avenue,
                        south of North Avenue, and east of LaSalle—to avoid streets that might be blocked for the Marathon route.
                        Among the hotels on this list that are in this area are:
                        The Sofitel, The Tremont, The Millennium Knickerbocker, and The Westin (Michigan Avenue location).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We'd encourage visitors to stay in downtown Chicago so you can experience the city,
                        and so you can more easily join us for drinks at Formento's Friday night and/or brunch
                        at the Ambassador Sunday morning, but if you would like to stay close to the wedding venue
                        itself, you could consider the <a class="styled-link" href="https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/chinb-renaissance-chicago-north-shore-hotel/" target="_blank">Renaissance Chicago North Shore</a>.

            <h2 class="category-title">Chicago Marathon</h2>
            <p>
                The Chicago Marathon will be held on Sunday, October 7, the morning after the wedding.
                The Marathon shouldn't interfere with our fun because our hotels are situated so that we can get to
                North Michigan Avenue and Lake Shore Drive without having to cross the runners’ path during the run.
            </p>
            <p>
                On Sunday morning, some streets in Chicago will be blocked off for the Marathon, but these streets
                should be south and west of our hotels.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you need to go to O’Hare Airport on Sunday morning, your taxi or ride-share car should be able to avoid
                the route by going from our hotels north on Lake Shore Drive before taking one of the major streets west
                to the expressway (or you can take the El). We'll be happy to provide further info for you if you need it.
                By mid- to late-afternoon, all streets should be open again.

                Architectural Boat Tour
            </a></p>
            <p>
                Chicago has outstanding examples of architecture in a wide variety of
                styles, and one of the best ways to see Chicago’s architecture and to learn about the history of Chicago
                is an architectural boat tour. The Chicago Architecture Foundation offers these cruises on the Chicago
                River. The boat can be caught at the southeast corner of the
                Michigan Avenue Bridge at Wacker Dr. (look for the blue awning).

            </a></p>
            <p>
                This area was transformed from an urban eyesore into one of the
                city’s most charming parks. There are a number of unique structures and sculptures scattered
                throughout the park, but the foremost must-see sculpture is “The Bean,” actually entitled “Cloud Gate.”
                You have to look at it from all angles, including underneath, see the reflections of city and sky, and take
                the mandatory photo of yourself with this beautiful art work. Walk east from The Bean toward the
                lakefront and see Frank Geary’s twisted metal concert venue, the various gardens, and Maggie Daley
                Park, which has an ice skating trail, rather than a rink, and a playground for all ages—you can even go
                rock climbing!

            <p>
                One of the world’s great art museums is just a short taxi or bus ride (or
                pretty long stroll) down Michigan Avenue from our hotels. Especially known for its extensive collection
                of Impressionist paintings, this museum really has everything, from the largest collection of African
                ceramics in America, to Medieval armor and weapons, to one of the finest collections of Japanese
                woodblock prints in the world, to Italian Renaissance paintings, to the fascinating Thorne Miniature
                Rooms. There is a nice place for lunch called Terzo Piano on the top floor of the new wing, with a
                terrace overlooking Millennium Park and the Chicago skyline.

            <p>
                If you make your way down to Hyde Park, our neighborhood, we have some
                favorite spots to recommend:
                Of course, you should check out the <a class="styled-link" target="_blank" href="https://maps.uchicago.edu">University of Chicago campus</a>. Check out the Midway Plaisance
                (just south of 59th Street), a stretch of green parkway which was once a lagoon surrounded by the
                buildings of the 1893 World’s Colombian Exposition, described in The Devil in the White City.
                Then wander around the beautiful quadrangle between 57th Street and 59th Street, and Ellis and
                University Avenues. Swift Hall, where Sarah spends a lot of time, and the adjacent Bond Chapel, are
                particularly lovely.
                A couple of blocks away, at the corner of 58th and Woodlawn, you can tour the <a class="styled-link" target="_blank" href="https://flwright.org/visit/robiehouse">Frederick Robie
                House</a>, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.
                The <a class="styled-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.msichicago.org">Museum of Science and Industry</a>, with its unique and quirky collection (you can visit a German
                submarine, explore a coal mine, or step into a tornado), is worth a visit. It is the only remaining building
                from the Colombian Exposition.
